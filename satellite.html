                    <p class="description">It's a body orbiting the massive bodies. And an artificial body placed in orbit round the earth or moon or some other massive body in order to collect raw information or for communication purposes.</p>
                </fieldset>
                <p>Satellites can operate by themselves or as part of a larger system, a satellite formation or satellite constellation.</p>
                <p>Satellites are used for many different purposes. Among several other applications, they can be used to plot out star maps and the maps of planetary surfaces, and also take pictures of planets they are launched to.</p>
                <p>Let's get to know about the Artifical Satellites in detail:</p>

                <p>The term geostationary comes from the fact that such a satellite appears nearly stationary in the sky as seen by a ground-based observer. </p>
                <p>A geostationary satellite is an earth-orbiting satellite, placed at an altitude of approximately 35,800 kilometers (22,300 miles) directly over the equator, that revolves in the same direction the earth rotates (west to east). At this
                    altitude, one orbit takes 24 hours, the same length of time as the earth requires to rotate once on its axis.</p>
                <p>BGAN, the new global mobile communications network, uses geostationary satellites like

                <p>A polar orbit is one in which a satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited on each revolution. It therefore has an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degrees to the equator.</p>
                <p>Polar satellites revolve around the earth in a north-south direction around the earth as opposed to east-west like the geostationary satellites.</p>

                <p>A weather satellite or meteorological satellite is a type of Earth observation satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the Earth.</p>
                <p>As early as 1946, the idea of cameras in orbit to observe the weather was being developed. This was due to sparse data observation coverage and the expense of using cloud cameras on rockets</p>
