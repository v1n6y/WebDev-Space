                    <h1>Why is it called the Solar System?</h1>
                    <p class="description">There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is named the "solar system" because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and anything related
                        to the Sun we call "solar."</p>
                </fieldset>
                <p>The planetary system we reccide in is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
                <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – all the eight officially considered planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; and dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens
                    of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

                <p>Our Sun is a <code>4.5 billion</code> -year-old star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as
                    we know it could not exist here on our home planet. </p>
                <p>The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit
                    around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends
                    out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.</p>
                <p>NASA and other international space agencies monitor the Sun 24/7 with a fleet of spacecraft, studying everything from its atmosphere to its surface, and even peering inside the Sun using special instruments. Sun-exploring spacecraft include

                    <ol>
                        <li>The Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider than Jupiter, the biggest planet. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be about the size of a nickel.</li>
                        <li>The Sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it – the planets, asteroids, comets, and tiny bits
                            of space debris.</li>
                        <li>Measuring a “day” on the Sun is complicated because of the way it rotates. It doesn't spin as a single, solid ball. This is because the Sun’s surface isn't solid like Earth's. Instead, the Sun is made of super-hot, electrically
                            charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth
                            days.
                        </li>
                        <li>The part of the Sun we see from Earth – the part we call the surface – is the photosphere. The Sun doesn’t actually have a solid surface because it’s a ball of plasma.</li>
                        <li>Above the Sun’s surface are its thin chromosphere and the huge corona (crown). This is where we see features such as solar prominences, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The latter two are giant explosions of energy and particles
                            that can reach Earth.</li>
                        <li>The Sun doesn’t have moons, but it’s orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and perhaps three trillion comets and icy bodies.</li>
                        <li>Several spacecraft are currently investigating the Sun including Parker Solar Probe, STEREO, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, IRIS, and Wind.</li>
                        <li>The Sun would have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early in its history when the solar system was first forming <code>4.6 billion</code> years ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle
                            the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place around the Sun. </li>
                        <li>Nothing could live on the Sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.</li>
                        <li>The temperature in the Sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius) – hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from
                            collapsing.
                        </li>

                <p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest
                    planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.</p>

                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These are not identical
                    twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.</p>
                <p>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system,
                    even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains
                    and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active</p>
                <p>Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.</p>
                <p>Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system. This means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite to what we experience
                    on Earth. (It’s not the only planet in our solar system with such an oddball rotation – Uranus spins on its side.)</p>
                <p>Venus was the first planet to be explored by a spacecraft – NASA’s Mariner 2 successfully flew by and scanned the cloud-covered world on Dec. 14, 1962. Since then, numerous spacecraft from the U.S. and other space agencies have explored
                    Venus, including NASA’s Magellan, which mapped the planet's surface with radar. Soviet spacecraft made the most successful landings on the surface of Venus to date, but they didn’t survive long due to the extreme heat and crushing
                    pressure. An American probe, one of NASA's Pioneer Venus Multiprobes, survived for about an hour after impacting the surface in 1978.</p>
                <p>More recent Venus missions include ESA’s Venus Express (which orbited from 2006 until 2016) and Japan’s Akatsuki Venus Climate Orbiter (orbiting since 2016). NASA’s
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe"> Parker Solar Probe</a> has made multiple flybys of Venus. On Feb. 9, 2022, NASA announced the spacecraft had captured its first visible light images of the surface
                    of Venus from space during its February 2021 flyby.</p>

                        <li>Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in size and structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a dense, toxic atmosphere.</li>
                        <li>The average surface of Venus is less than a billion years old, and possibly as young as <code>150 million</code> years old – which is relatively young from a geological perspective. This is a major conundrum for scientists – they
                            don’t know exactly what happened that made Venus completely resurface itself.</li>
                        <li>Venus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was intensely studied early in the history of space exploration. Venus was also the first planet whose surface was reached by a spacecraft from Earth. The intense heat means
                            landers have only survived for a couple of hours.</li>
                        <li>Venus rotates backward on its axis compared to most planets in our solar system. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east, opposite of what we see on Earth.</li>

                <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid
                    water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</p>
                <p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about <code>4.5 billion</code> years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth
                    has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.</p>
                <p>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for
                    extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about <code>3.8 billion</code> years ago.</p>
                <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>
                <p>Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space. (The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun.) When
                    charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and southern
                    lights. The magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to the North Pole regardless of which way you turn. But the magnetic polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction of the magnetic field. The geologic record
                    tells scientists that a magnetic reversal takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the timing is very irregular. As far as we know, such a magnetic reversal doesn't cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is very
                    unlikely to happen for at least another thousand years. But when it does happen, compass needles are likely to point in many different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being made. And after the switch is completed,
                    they will all point south instead of north.​</p>

                <p>​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the
                    past.
                </p>
                <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA currently has two rovers (
                    <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/">Curiosity</a> and
                    <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/">Perseverance</a> ), one lander (

                    <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/">Ingenuity</a> ) exploring the surface of Mars. </p>
                <p>Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The Ingenuity helicopter rode
                    to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance. Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the United Arab Emirates arrived on Feb. 9, 2021. China’s Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb.
                    10, 2021, and includes an orbiter, a lander, and a rover. Europe and India also have spacecraft studying Mars from orbit.</p>
                <p>In May 2021, China became the

                <p>Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
                <p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name
                    from the king of the ancient Roman gods. Jupiter's four largest moons – Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are
                    known today as the Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even
                    bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, making it a tempting
                    place to explore.</p>
                <p>Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds
                    of years.</p>
                <p>One spacecraft – NASA's
                    <a href="/missions/juno/in-depth/">Juno orbiter</a> – is currently exploring this giant world. Juno’s data also shows that the belts and zones undergo a transition around 40 miles (65 kilometers) beneath Jupiter’s water clouds. At
                    shallow depths, Jupiter’s belts are brighter in microwave light than the neighboring zones. But at deeper levels, below the water clouds, the opposite is true – which reveals a similarity to our oceans.</p>

                        <li>Eleven Earths could fit across Jupiter’s equator. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be the size of a basketball.</li>
                        <li>Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).</li>
                        <li>Jupiter is a gas giant and so lacks an Earth-like surface. If it has a solid inner core at all, it’s likely only about the size of Earth.</li>
                        <li>Jupiter's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).</li>
                        <li>Jupiter has more than 75 moons.</li>
                        <li>In 1979 the Voyager mission discovered Jupiter’s faint ring system. All four giant planets in our solar system have ring systems.</li>
                        <li>Nine spacecraft have visited Jupiter. Seven flew by and two have orbited the gas giant. Juno, the most recent, arrived at Jupiter in 2016.</li>
                        <li>Jupiter cannot support life as we know it. But some of Jupiter's moons have oceans beneath their crusts that might support life.</li>
                        <li>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that’s about twice the size of Earth and has raged for over a century.</li>

                <p>The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter.</p>
                <p>Saturn is adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.</p>
                <p>Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>
                <p>Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about <code>4.5 billion</code> years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. About <code>4 billion</code> years ago, Saturn settled into its
                    current position in the outer solar system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun.</p>

                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally
                    thought it was either a comet or a star.</p>
                <p>William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.</p>
                <p>It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III.
                    Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.​</p>
                <p>Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about <code>4.5 billion</code> years ago – when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely formed closer to the
                    Sun and moved to the outer solar system about <code>4 billion</code> years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun.</p>
                <p>Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia. The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.</p>
                <p> While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot, and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986 – more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, including rapidly changing
                    bright features.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).</li>
                        <li>Uranus is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.</li>
                        <li>Uranus has an atmosphere made mostly of molecular hydrogen and atomic helium, with a small amount of methane.</li>
                        <li>Uranus has 27 known moons, and they are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</li>
                        <li>Uranus has 13 known rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark and the outer rings are brightly colored.</li>
                        <li>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to fly by Uranus. No spacecraft has orbited this distant planet to study it at length and up close.</li>
                        <li>Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west. But Uranus is unique in that it rotates on its side.</li>

                <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.</p>
                <p>More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit
                    since its discovery in 1846.</p>
