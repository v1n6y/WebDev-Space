                    <h1>Why is it called the Telescope?</h1>
                    <p class="description">Its an optical instrument designed to make distant objects appear nearer. It contains an arrangement of lenses, or of curved mirrors and lenses in combination, by which rays of light are collected and focused and the resulting image
                        magnified providing more accurate information.</p>
                </fieldset>
                <p>The telescope is undoubtedly the most important investigative tool in astronomy. It provides a means of collecting and analyzing radiation from celestial objects, even those in the far reaches of the universe.</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> revolutionized astronomy when he applied the telescope to the study of extraterrestrial bodies in the early 17th century. Until then, magnification instruments
                    had never been used for this purpose. Since Galileo’s pioneering work, increasingly more powerful optical telescopes have been developed, as has a wide array of instruments capable of detecting and measuring radiation in every region

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. Observational capability has been further enhanced by the invention of various kinds of auxiliary instruments (e.g., the camera,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_spectrometer">spectrograph</a>, and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device">charge-coupled device</a>) and by the use of electronic computers, rockets, and spacecraft in conjunction with telescope systems. These developments have contributed dramatically
                    to advances in scientific knowledge about the solar system, the Milky Way Galaxy, and the universe as a whole.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Commonly known as refractors, telescopes of this kind are typically used to examine the Moon, other objects of the solar system such as Jupiter and Mars, and binary stars. The name refractor is derived from the term
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/refraction">refraction</a>, which is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another of different density—e.g., from air to glass. The glass is referred to as a lens and may
                    have one or more components.</p>
                <p>Refracting telescopes use lenses to gather light and focus it to a point. This was the first type of telescope to be invented, in the early 17th century, and was first used for serious astronomy by
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>, 400 years ago. The images produced are upright, which makes refractors good for ground based observations.</p>
                <p>Modern refracting telescopes use two or more lenses to reduce an effect called
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration">chromatic aberration</a> that causes different wavelengths of light to focus at different points. Refractors with two lens elements are called achromatic refractors. Apochromatic
                    refractors use three or more lenses, at least one of which has special properties, to completely eliminate
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration">chromatic aberration</a>. These telescopes give the best quality image, and are very good for photography, but they are also very expensive for their size. Refractors also
                    need to be longer than
                    <a href="#Schmidt_Cassegrain_Telescopes" class="nav-link">Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescopes</a> for the same aperture size and are hard to build on large scales.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Reflectors use mirrors, which causes light to reflect at various angles within the optical tube, extending the overall light path. This often causes reflectors to be shorter than refractors of the same aperture, as the light doesn’t need
                    to flow in a straight line to move the same distance. When combined with how manufacturing large mirrors is often cheaper than manufacturing large lenses, it’s fairly common for reflectors to be much less expensive than refractors
                    at larger apertures.</p>
                <p>Additionally, reflectors are not susceptible to color fringing in the same way that double refractors are. If you’re looking for a lot of bang for your buck in terms of aperture, reflectors are a great way to go. This is especially true
                    for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope">Dobsonian telescopes</a> which come with their own easy-to-use rocker-box mount.</p>
                <p>Reflectors can be a great value with many conveniences. They can also come in a variety of sizes and can get quite large. With this in mind, purchasing the largest reflector you can afford is a great low-cost way to get a high-aperture
                    scope. Just make sure you are able to store and transport it safely.</p>
                <p>There are some things you should consider about the reflector design. By default, the image you see through a reflector’s eyepiece will be upside down. For this reason, you’ll want to use your scope’s finder to line it up with the objects
                    you want to see before looking through the eyepiece. Most modern reflecting telescopes come with a finder scope or a red dot finder, so you most likely won’t have to make an additional purchase to acquire this.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Newtonian telescopes are reflectors. They use a mirror, rather than a lens, to focus light from distant objects. Reflecting telescopes were first invented by Isaac Newton to avoid the problems of chromatic aberration found with refractors.
                    They use a curved mirror to focus light onto a second flat mirror, from which the light is directed to an eye-piece.</p>
                <p>In order to work properly, Newtonian telescopes must have their mirrors perfectly aligned. This is called collimation, and is necessary to make sure that the optics of the telescope are effective. Reflectors are the least expensive telescopes
                    for their aperture size and large reflectors are easier to build</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope">Dobsonian telescopes</a> are Newtonian telescopes held on a special mount by friction. They are very cheap to build and simple to opperate, making them very popular with beginners
                    and amateur astronomers.

                        <li>Early Newtonian telescopes were made for real science work. Now, "newtonians" are mostly used by amateur astronomers. The most popular type is the Dobsonian telescope, which is on a simple rockerbox mount. People like them because
                            they are cheap to make and easy to use.</li>
                        <li>They are free of chromatic aberration found in refracting telescopes. Newtonian telescopes are usually less expensive for any given objective diameter (or aperture) than comparable quality telescopes of other types.</li>

            <article>
                <p>Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes (SCT) have the advantage that they are much smaller than other types of telescope because they use a series of mirrors to fold the light path. All professional telescopes, including the Faulkes telescopes,
                    are now of the SCT design.</p>
                <p>A Cassegrain telescope is a catch-all term used to describe a general telescope design which uses a convex primary mirror and a concave secondary mirror. Light enters through the front of the tube and passes to the bottom where it reflects
                    off the primary mirror, back up to the secondary mirror, and then finally back down out the back of the telescope to the focal plane. This is what's known as "folded optics" in the telescope world, and it allows for a very long focal
                    length design in a compact body.</p>
                <p>SCTs use a spherical primary mirror to focus the parallel rays of incoming light onto a convex secondary mirror. This then reflects the light back through a hole in the primary mirror to the eyepiece or detector.</p>
                <p>The only drawback with these telescopes is that the shape of the primary mirror introduces spherical aberration. This happens because a spherical mirror will focus the light to slightly different points, blurring the image. This can be
                    corrected either by using a corrector plate or by using a parabolic primary mirror instead of a spherical one, although these are more expensive to make. </p>

                    <legend>Fun Fcats About Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescopes</legend>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Cassegrain telescope has a curved focal surface which is located behind the primary mirror. Due to the onset of coma and astigmatism, the telescope has a modest useful field-of-view.</li>
                        <li>A "true Cassegrain" uses a primary mirror with a parabola-shaped curve, and a secondary mirror with a hyperbola-shaped curve. This is hard to make. Sphere-shaped curves are easier to make, but the image would be blurry. Catadioptric
                            (lens and mirror) telescopes fix this by putting a special lens in front of the telescope.</li>
                        <li>The catadioptrics’ small size and portability give them a convenience not found in reflectors of the same class, making them a great investment for both beginners and experienced astronomers alike.</li>

            <article>
                <p>When it was built in 1979, it was originally called the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) because it combined the light collected by six 180-cm- (70-inch-) diameter telescopes into a single image. It thus had the light-gathering power of
                    a single 450-cm (176-inch) telescope.</p>
                <p>The main reason astronomers build larger telescopes is to increase light-gathering power so that they can see deeper into the universe. Unfortunately, the cost of constructing larger single-mirror telescopes increases rapidly—approximately
                    with the cube of the diameter of the aperture. Thus, in order to achieve the goal of increasing light-gathering power while keeping costs down, it has become necessary to explore new, more economical and nontraditional telescope designs.</p>

                <p>Radio telescope, astronomical instrument consisting of a radio receiver and an antenna system that is used to detect radio-frequency radiation between wavelengths of about 10 metres (30 megahertz [MHz]) and 1 mm (300 gigahertz [GHz]) emitted
                    by extraterrestrial sources, such as stars, galaxies, and quasars. (See radio and radar astronomy.)</p>
                <p>Radio telescopes detect and amplify radio waves from space, turning them into signals that astronomers use to enhance our understanding of the Universe. A radio telescope is simply a telescope that is designed to receive radio waves from
                    space. In its simplest form it has three components: One or more antennas to collect the incoming radio waves.</p>
                <p>Extraterrestrial radio emission was first reported in 1933 by Karl Jansky, an engineer at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, while he was searching for the cause of shortwave interference. Jansky had mounted a directional radio antenna on
                    a turntable so that he could point it at different parts of the sky to determine the direction of the interfering signals. He not only detected interference from distant thunderstorms but also located a source of radio “noise” from
                    the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. This first detection of cosmic radio waves received much attention from the public but only passing notice from the astronomical community.</p>

                <p>The design of this type of telescope must be radically different from that of a conventional optical telescope. Since X-ray photons have so much energy, they would pass right through the mirror of a standard reflector. X-rays must be bounced
                    off a mirror at a very low angle if they are to be captured. This technique is referred to as grazing incidence. For this reason, the mirrors in X-ray telescopes are mounted with their surfaces only slightly off a parallel line with
                    the incoming X-rays. Application of the grazing-incidence principle makes it possible to focus X-rays from a cosmic object into an image that can be recorded electronically.</p>
